# introduction

This assignment aims to create a multi-label image classifier capable of predicting the labels of a given image. The classifier can utilize the image's title selectively as part of its input. The task is a classification problem with multiple labels, indicating that each image can be associated with multiple labels. We employ a hybrid strategy that incorporates both image data and associated descriptions
